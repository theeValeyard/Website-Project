    <h1>Bastard</h1>
<p>If you are an anime fan, the hype of the Tower of God is hard to miss. With the rise of Tower of God being one of the most talked-about anime of the season, a lot of eyes have turned towards Manwha as the new source of great entertainment. Now, whether the hype surrounding the tower of god is justified or not is a topic for another day. But if you are interested in anime, or manga, or both, you really should not ignore Manwha. Why you might ask? Well, let me tell you. </p>

<h3>So, What is a Manwha?</h3>
<p>Let us start with a basic introduction to what a Manwha is. A Manwha is a Korean manga (Comic). Manwha has existed in Korea (mainly South Korea) for a long time, but their international success started in the 2000s, because of Webtoon and digital Manwha.<br>
Manwha most closely resembles Japanese Manga, so it is a lot easier for people who read the Manga to familiarise themselves with Manwha. They have a lot of similar tropes, and their art style also resembles Japanese Manga rather than western comics. But they also have some key differences, most of which are because of the way Manwha is consumed as compared to Manga.<br>
You see, a regular manga is made in the most traditional fashion of printing with several panels on a single page read right to left. They are still uploaded digitally, but their real revenue is generated from physical sales. Webtoons, on the other hand, have emerged in popularity in the age of smartphones, and phones are the reason they are the way they are. Webtoons are meant to be consumed digitally, they are made like that. A Manwha is read on a smartphone top to the bottom, with only one panel at a time.</p>

<h3> Where should you start? </h3>

<p>So, let's say that you want to start reading Manwha. But where should you start? There are thousands of options out there, including the beforementioned Tower of God, which is definitely a great choice, but for anyone just starting out, I would like to suggest BASTARD. There are several reasons to start here, whether it be the fact that it only has 94 chapters or that it is finished as of writing this article or that it is more conventional in its ideas (relatively of course). So let's talk about that.<br>
Bastard started its run on June 8, 2015, which lasted till March 20, 2017, with 94 chapters. The series was written by Kim, Carnby, and illustrated by Hwang, Young-chan, who later went on to write Sweet home. Another great webtoon. <br>


First, a disclaimer, this series is certainly not for everyone as it has a great deal of violence, abuse, and sexual assault, so viewer discretion is advised. <br>
The series is about a teenager Jin Seon, whose father is a very wealthy and respected businessman, and that would have been great for Jin except for the fact that his father is also a serial killer who loves torturing and killing young women. Ever since Jin was a child, he has been an accomplice in his father's crimes. As a child, he did not know any better and as a teenager under his father's fear.</p>
<img class="bastard-pic" src="images/brave_BLiw2gUWxw.png" alt="photo from bastard manhwa" width="45%">
<p>When Jin was a child, he met with an "accident" which left him with several broken bones, heart valves, and a glass eye. So fair to say, he is not in the best condition to oppose his father. It also does not help that he has been conditioned in a way to relay on his father to the point that he has no idea how people who don't have as much money as them live.

The real trouble starts when a new transfer student arrives at his school, and Jin takes a liking to her, but sadly so does Jin’s dad. So, now it is a cat and mouse game where Jin has to do everything in his power to stop his dad. (For anyone familiar with Erased anime, this has some similar vibes)
It is equally fun and terrifying to watch Jin’s progression from the kind with no self-esteem and no power to someone who can stand up for himself and others. </p>

<p>The Webtoon introduces a lot of interesting characters, the most important ones being manny Kim. All of the characters are really well done, especially the dad, he just exudes the psychopath killer vibes, and when he fools people with his flawless lying skill, it’s something to be experienced. There are some undoubtedly smart plays by the characters that are the remainest of L and Light from death note, but obviously, death is in a completely different ballpark. <br>

But it's not all good either, the fact that it is so short makes sure that it never gets too slow or dull, it is generally a compact story, but this short length sometimes feels like the characters are progressing a little too fast. However, the progression does make sense, which is another point in its favor. There is also the fact that sometimes the characters make dumb decisions, which, if within the character are infuriating nonetheless.</p>

<p>Still, Bastard is one of the best Webtoons I have experienced so far, and the ending will leave you satisfied yet wishing for more. And if you crave more, you can check out their next series, Sweet home (Review soon).<br>
All said, Bastard, is probably the best start to your journey into the world of Webtoons.<br>
