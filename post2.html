<p>So with the release of Shadow and Bone, this is the start of the tidal wave of fantasy adaptations that we are supposed to come out in the next few years. Now I’m still trying to figure out a format for these reviews and everything I talk about you will find the time stamps in the description. <br>
Right now, first I am going to tell what the show is and what it's about, then I will tell you what it's not, because there are a lot of misconceptions about it online. And after that I’ll tell if the show is good and if it's worth your time. So lets start.</p>

<p>Shadow and bone is the latest fantasy adaptation made by netflix. It has 8 episodes and has been adapted from the grishaverse by leigh bardugo. The story is about Alina Starkov, she is the chosen one in this story and she doesn't know she's the chosen one. Typical YA fantasy stuff. The story takes place in a place called ravka, now ravka has been divided into 2 parts, east ravka and west ravka by something called the fold, it is a big mass of darkness, big enough to divide a country in half. <br>And of course it's dangerous to enter because of the creatures that live inside called the Volkara. Now to complete this fantasy world there are  a small minority of  people in this universe who can use magic or highly complicated science called grisha. It's mostly elemental magic, think avatar the last air  bender, but there are other things as well, elemnal is the most common. Also there's gun and its inspired by russia. </p>
 
<p>As for what the show is not? It is not the next Game of thrones or the next Witcher because it's not trying to be. Just because it's fantasy that doesn't mean it's all going to be the same. Shadow and Bone is a Young Adult fantasy, if it's 70 percent fantasy 30 percent is going to be teen drama and stuff like that. Parts of this show are going to be more similar to the hunger games than they are to something like the witcher. I need to mention this because a lot of people have done this comparison and it's not really fair to the show or the audience for that matter, because it creates false expectations, and that's never good. </p>

<p>So with that all out of the way, let's talk about what the show is actually like. 
The show focus on 3 major plot lines, First is of course about alina and how she is cartagorar for the ravkan army, theres of course other major characters in this plot line, general kirigan, and mal and this plot lines is the the most fantasy and also the most teen. Then there's the second plot line with the crows, this plot line feels like a completely different show, but in a good way. It is adapted from the Six of crows which is a fantasy crime thriller heist series, and it has major guy ritchie sherlock holmes vibes. Both these plot lines are pretty good on their own and they get even better when they merge together. <br>Now the third plot is the most boring in the series, it just feels unnecessary, I can't spoil it because it starts around the 3rd episodes but it's easily the weakest part of the series. Luckily this plot line only takes abouts 5 to 10 percent of the series so it doesn't get too boring. <br>
Now if you don't watch or read a lot of fantasy the first episode might be a bit hard to get through, not because it's bad but it's definitely the most fantasy fantasy series in a while. They are just going to mention, fictional cities and fictional professions that only exist in that universe, and it can get overwhelming for someone who is not used to that sort of thing. You might even feel like you are missing something, but believe me it gets a lot better after the first 2 episodes. Unfortunately that's also when this show will be the most divisive. Because the middle of the show is going to be the most teen drama, There are points in the middle when it feels like you are watching a CW series. There's a love triangle because of course every young adult series needs a love triangle, there's the mean girl, characters making dumb decison, the whole pacakge. This I feel like is going to be the deal maker or breaker for most people. Almost everyone is going to like the crows storyline, but this is more complicated, if you like teen drama, you are going to love it, if you don't like it but it doesn't bother you are still going to really like the series. But if you can't stand it, the middle part might be hard to get through for you.
I think the best part about this show are the characters. Apart from the 3rd plotline I loved all of the characters, especially the crows. And this show has a really solid antagonist which is rare to find in young adult series. </p>
<p>I also have a few small nit picks which you may or may not notice. Overall the cgi is pretty good but there are a few fight scenes in the dark that don't look that good. There's also some weird cuts in these fights, like it's missing a sense of something. The series is also fairly predictable but there were a few decent twists. Also for a fantasy heavy series, there isn't a lot of magic that we get to see, I would have liked to see a bit more of the magic system, especially different uses of magic. I'll give you an example, so we have fold, and people still travel though it using sand skiffs which are basically land ships, but you need wind to run it. So they always have a grisha with them who can control air. That kind of stuff is cool, that the magic is used for more than just fighting or healing. 
All in all, if you can get past the few shortcomings this is a really good series. You just need to know what to expect. It's a really solid series but I think for most people the characters are going to be the most memorable part, the cgi is good but nothing mind blowing, the cinematography is good but again nothing exceptional. By technical standpoint the music might be the weakest part, not because it's bad, it just serves its purpose, it's nothing you will be putting as your ringtone. I am definitely looking forward to the next season and I think there are going to be 3 seasons and if you decide to watch it you wont regret it.
Thank You for watching and Ill see you next time. </p>
